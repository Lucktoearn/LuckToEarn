The COVID-19 pandemic positively impacted the market as consumers turned more to online platform to overcome their financial, social, and psychological crisis during the lockouts. One of the research conducted by Lund University in Sweden found that due to restrictions on sporting events due to blockades, consumers increased their interest in online gambling platforms. Also, in response to the closure of many gambling establishments, several operators have gone digital. Many players expanded their online gambling offerings and bingo operators changed their online offerings, which positively impacted the market.In the medium term, online gambling is expected to be the fastest growing segment. Artificial intelligence, Chabot and machine learning have dominated the market. The increasing number of female population in casinos and the convenience of cashless payment mode during games have likely driven the online gambling market during the forecast period.
