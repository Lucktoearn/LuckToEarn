# ðŸ’µ Staking

There is no entry fee to wager and a nominal 2% withdrawal fee which is distributed among other bettors as wagering rewards. Betting on the Luck To Earn platform allows holders to decide the best way to earn while holding. Users can keep and earn a portion of the 2% transaction fee in their wallets, or users can gamble to earn a portion of the 20% ticket sales fee that is distributed to punters. Users can also stake a part of their holdings and decide for themselves what is most profitable.
